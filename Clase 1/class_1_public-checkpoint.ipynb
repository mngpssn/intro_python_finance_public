    "### DRY Principle. \n",
    " is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,[1] replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy. The course is based in this principle. **Thats why it is written in English.** We want to avoid using other languange for coding.  we want code that is reproducible, clean and understood by majority of programmers. \n",

    "Also there are plently of well written tutorials and documentations by the creators of most of the libraries. I believe is a breach of the principle and a wast of time for both of use for me to re-write and re-teach you something that is already very well written. So , during the course I will use already build material and sources to point you to the references and will focus on help you build bridged between this references. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is easier to read and review when is nicely written. To write our code we will use Python PEP 8 standards \n",
    "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ Please read this document after the class today so you get familiar with it. Particulary on naming conventions. **And please if you spot any mistakes in my code or in the one of any of your classmates please let us know** \n",
    "\n",
    "### Impossible Is Nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the amount of resources online is soo broad that basically you can build and code anything you need. dont give up when you have an idea or a question is very likely someone already had it and someone answer it. remember your best friends are the wise google and stackoverflow. \n"

    "* 30-2:30: class concepts, exerices and examples\n",

    "Python applications will often use packages and modules that don’t come as part of the standard library. Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library, because the application may require that a particular bug has been fixed or the application may be written using an obsolete version of the library’s interface.\n",
    "This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. If application A needs version 1.0 of a particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one application unable to run.\n",
    "The solution for this problem is to create a virtual environment, a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)\n",

    "### Mini Introduction to Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.\n",
